# Quantum-Reinforcement-Learning
Jupyter notebooks of the simulations ran as part of a semester project on "Quantum Reinforcement Learning and Projective Simulation" at Télécom ParisTech.
UPDATE: added internship report on the subject "On the Quantum Speed-up of Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods for Reinforcement Learning" part of the completion of a 6-month internship at the University of Innbruck
